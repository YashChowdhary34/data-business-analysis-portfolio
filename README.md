# **Yash Chowdhary - Data Analyst Portfolio**

---

## **About**

Hi, I'm **Yash**, a recent graduate passionate about data analytics and data science.  
I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working with a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex business problems.

I have an engineering background and am currently seeking opportunities in the field of data analytics/data science as an entry-level data specialist.  
During my undergraduate years, I developed a strong foundation in core computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. I also gained experience working on study projects, developing skills to handle complex datasets, and identifying patterns and trends. Additionally, I have worked in the fields of digital marketing and content strategy.

## **Portfolio Projects**
In this section, I list my data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

---

### **Python**
Here are all the projects built using Python:

#### **Predictive CLV and Behaviour Analysis**  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/predictive_clv_behaviour_analysis)

- **Goal:** Determine customer buying patterns based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM).  
- **Description:** The project predicts the purchase amount and spending probability over the next 90 days. It uses the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into groups based on RFM scores, enabling tailored marketing strategies. The project also includes an XGBRegressor and XGBClassifier model to predict purchase probabilities and amounts.  
- **Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, feature engineering, ML algorithms, clustering, data visualization.  
- **Technology:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Plotly.  
- **Results:** Provided insights into customer behavior to improve engagement, retention, and revenue.

#### **Multichannel Customer Segmentation Analysis with ETL Pipeline**  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/multichannel_scoring_segmentation_analysis)

- **Goal:** Develop robust segmentation models, leveraging advanced analytics techniques, the aim is to identify distinct customer segments.
- **Description:** This project has a robust ETL pipeline to automate data ingestion from APIs, databases, and local files, ensuring seamless integration. I have integrated Apache Kafka to enable real-time data streaming, ensuring continuous flow and scalability. The loaded data is then clustered and there's a separate analysis section for outliers as they are the high-spending and high-frequency customers which cannot be ignored. It's an end-to-end analysis system that focuses on customer segmentation to understand interaction patterns and tailor marketing strategies for better engagement and retention.
- **Skills:** Data Extraction, data transformation, data cleaning, segmentation, feature engineering, clustering, data visualization
- **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Apache Kafka, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy
- **Results:** Demonstrated how multichannel data can be leveraged to create actionable customer segments. By combining advanced analytics with data visualization, we enable data-driven strategies to improve customer engagement and drive business growth. 

#### **Crypto Real-Time Data Analysis and Forecasting**  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/crypto-realtime-data-analysis-python)

- **Goal:** Fetch cryptocurrency data from an API, analyze it, and automate daily email reporting.  
- **Description:** This project automates fetching real-time cryptocurrency data, performing analysis, generating forecasts, and sending daily reports via email. The daily report includes a CSV file of the dataset and a Jupyter Notebook with visualizations.  
- **Skills:** Descriptive analysis, data visualizations, forecasting, automation.  
- **Technology:** Python, Facebook Prophet, Matplotlib, Pandas, Requests, Schedule, SMTP.  
- **Results:** Showcases automation in real-time data analysis and reporting, enabling informed decision-making in the volatile cryptocurrency market.
