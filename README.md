# **Yash Chowdhary - Data Analyst Portfolio**

## About

Hi, I'm Yash, a recent grad and this is my portfolio.
I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether
working with a team or independently. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex business problems.

I have an engineering background and currently, I am looking for opportunities in the field of data analytics/data science as an entry-level
data specialist. During my undergrad, I developed a strong foundation in core computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. While working on study projects I developed an ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends.
I have also worked in the field of digital marketing and content strategy.

This is my CV in pdf.

This repository was built to showcase my analytical and technical skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics. (Excel, Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, PowerPoint, and others)

# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list my data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Python 
Here I have listed all the projects that are built using Python.

### Predictive CLV and Behaviour Analysis
Repo -> [!predictive_clv_behaviour_analysis](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/predictive_clv_behaviour_analysis)

##### Goal: To determine customer buying patterns based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM)

##### Description: The project focused on predicting the purchase amount and spending probability over the next 90 days. It used the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into groups based on their RFM scores. This segmentation will help identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies. Here I also developed a machine learning model using XGBRegressor and XGBClassifier to predict the probability of customer purchase and the likely purchase amount.

##### Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, feature engineering, ml algorithms, clustering, data visualization
##### Technology: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Plotly
##### Results: this project provided valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing businesses to improve customer engagement, retention, and revenue.

### Multichannel Customer Scoring and Segmentation Analysis with ETL pipeline
Repo -> [multichannel_scoring_segmentation_analysis](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/multichannel_scoring_segmentation_analysis)

### Crypto real-time data analysis and Forecasting
Repo -> [crypto-realtime-data-analysis-python](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/crypto-realtime-data-analysis-python)

##### Goal: To fetch crypto data from an external API, perform analysis, and automate daily email reporting.

##### Description: This project automates fetching real-time cryptocurrency data, performing basic analysis, generating forecasts, and sending daily reports via email. The daily report includes a CSV file containing the complete dataset and a Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and projections for the cryptocurrency market.

##### Skills: descriptive analysis, data visualizations, forecasting, automation
##### Technology: Python, Facebook Prophet, Matplotlib, Pandas, Requests, Schedule, SMTP
##### Results: This project demonstrates the power of automation in simplifying complex tasks like real-time data analysis and reporting. By combining Python libraries with API integration, email automation, and scheduling, this project serves as a robust tool for staying informed about the volatile cryptocurrency market.

## SQL
Here I have listed all the projects that are built using SQL queries and MySQL database.

### Amazon Data Analysis
Repo -> [amazon-data-analysis-SQL](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/amazon-data-analysis-SQL)

##### Goal: Solve key business problems that would exist in an amazon-like scenario, directly on the database.

##### Description: This project is a comprehensive analysis of an Amazon-like e-commerce platform using SQL. Through advanced SQL queries, the project derives actionable business insights and solves critical operational challenges.

##### Skills: DBMS, er-diagram, SQL
##### Technology: MySQL
##### Results: This project demonstrates the power of SQL in solving complex business problems for an e-commerce platform. By simulating a real-world dataset, it showcases advanced querying techniques and offers actionable insights into operations, sales, and customer behavior.

### Zomato Data Analysis
Repo -> [zomato-data-analysis-SQL](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/zomato-data-analysis-SQL)

##### Goal: To analyze Zomato's restaurant data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights.

##### Description: This project involves analyzing Zomato's restaurant data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The dataset includes information on restaurants, locations, cuisines, ratings, and more, enabling comprehensive analysis of the food delivery market.

##### Skills: DBMS, er-diagram, SQL
##### Technology: MySQL
##### Results: This project showcases the application of SQL in analyzing real-world datasets to extract business insights. By examining various aspects of the Zomato dataset, we've provided valuable information that can aid in strategic decision-making for stakeholders in the food delivery industry.

### Netflix Data Analysis
Repo -> [netflix-data-analysis-SQL](https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/netflix-data-analysis-SQL)

##### Goal: To address key business problems related to content distribution, audience preferences, and platform growth.

##### Description: This project focuses on analyzing Netflix data using SQL to uncover trends, insights, and actionable business strategies. By querying a dataset containing information about Netflix’s content, we aim to address key business problems related to content distribution, audience preferences, and platform growth.

##### Skills: DBMS, er-diagram, SQL
##### Technology: MySQL
##### Results: This project showcases the utility of SQL in deriving actionable insights from Netflix’s content dataset. By addressing critical business problems, it provides a foundation for informed decision-making in content strategy and platform growth.

## R
