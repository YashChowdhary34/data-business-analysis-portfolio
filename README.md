# **Yash Chowdhary - Data Analyst Portfolio**

## About

Hi, I'm Yash, a recent grad and this is my portfolio.
I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether
working with a team or independently. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex business problems.

I have an engineering background and currently, I am looking for opportunities in the field of data analytics/data science as an entry-level
data specialist. During my undergrad, I developed a strong foundation in core computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. While working on study projects I developed an ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends.
I have also worked in the field of digital marketing and content strategy.

This is my CV in pdf.

This repository was built to showcase my analytical and technical skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics. (Excel, Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, PowerPoint, and others)
