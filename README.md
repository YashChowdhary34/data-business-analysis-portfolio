# **Yash Chowdhary - Data Analyst Portfolio**

---

## **About**

Hi, I'm **Yash**, a recent graduate passionate about data analytics and data science.  
I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working with a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex business problems.

I have an engineering background and am currently seeking opportunities in the field of data analytics/data science as an entry-level data specialist.  
During my undergraduate years, I developed a strong foundation in core computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. I also gained experience working on study projects, developing skills to handle complex datasets, and identifying patterns and trends. Additionally, I have worked in the fields of digital marketing and content strategy.

This repository was built to showcase my analytical and technical skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science-related topics like **Excel, Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, PowerPoint**, and others.
