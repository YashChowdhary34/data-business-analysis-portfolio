# **Yash Chowdhary - Data Analyst Portfolio**

## About

Hi, I'm Yash, a recent grad (CSE-AI) and this is my portfolio.
I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether
working with a team or independently. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex 
business problems.

I have an engineering background and currently, I am looking for opportunities in the field of data analytics/data science as an entry-level
data specialist. During my undergrad, I developed a strong foundation in core computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends.
I have also worked in the field of digital marketing and content strategy.

This is my CV -> link.

This repository was built to showcase my analytical and technical skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics. (Excel, Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, PowerPoint, and others)
